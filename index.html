        <p> Israh is a responsive Jekyll theme with a clean single column layout and not much else.</p>
        <p>This theme is an evolution of my [Ezora jekyll theme](https://github.com/ezrasavard/ezora-jekyll-theme) that reflects my own changing tastes. Most notably, Israh takes the focus off of header images so I don't have to find them for posts that don't need them.</p>
        <p>Like Ezora, Israh uses a fairly minimal set of layouts and sass, and will automatically conform to a sensible layout based on the YAML provided, unless a layout is specified. Width/height values are all defined in the top of main.scss as variables, so you don't have to hunt too far through the SCSS to tweak things.</p>
        <p>Notable _includes are the **topbar**, included in the default layout, the **navbar** and the **postlist**, which is a paginated pile of posts you can include in any page, like the default home page does. You can specify your navigation menu links in **navbar** if you don't like it generating them for all your pages, GitHub and LinkedIn accounts. You can also add more social accounts if you like by extending the list in navbar.html.</p>
